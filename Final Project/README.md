## About

This folder will contain the final build for the project that I hope to make while learning Vue.js: a new portfolio. 

My [current portfolio](https://beenhamow.xyz) was made with EJS while I was still getting into web development and is in urgent need of a makeover, I hope to do that using Vue.
